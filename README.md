# Design Like Mad

Design Like Mad is a non-profit organization that hosts 12-hr design marathons in different cities around the US. They bring together students and professionals designers to work on projects for local non-profits. On average an event will produce $40,000 of design work for non-profts who otherwise would not be able to afford it. 

The event is organized by local volunteers and one of the most time consuming processes for the organizers is sorting through all the applicants which total up to about 200 people. In order to form teams for the event they have to take into account the type and skill level of the designer, whether they are a student or profressional, and pair them with non-profit based on the type project. This process can take anywhere between 12hr-24hr to put together. 

My goal for this project is to automate the procress by <javascript stuff>
